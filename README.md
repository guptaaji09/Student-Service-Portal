# Student-Service-Portal
Web services technologies are emerging as a new approach for supporting e-Science and e-Engineering by providing access to heterogeneous computation resources and integration of distributed scientific applications. In this project, a web-based service portal for students that enables them to access the distributed application through the web interface and to fulfil all their campus related tasks such as Resume Making, Certificate Collection etc. The portal design demonstrates that flexibility, reusability, and interoperability can be provided for both end users and portal developers by using semantic web services technologies.
